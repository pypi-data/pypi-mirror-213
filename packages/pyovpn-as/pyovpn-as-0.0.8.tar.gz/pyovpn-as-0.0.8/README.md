# Python OpenVPN Access Server SDK

A Python library built on XML-RPC that demystifies remote interaction with OpenVPN Access Server

OpenVPN Access Server provides an XML-RPC API that allows administrators to manage the server remotely and programatically. Unfortunately, OpenVPN explicitly provides this feature undocumented. This SDK provides a way to interact with this API, with helpful error messages, powerful functionality, and a clear explanation of what the hell you're looking at.

For support please email [peritz@pardonmynoot.com](mailto:peritz@pardonmynoot.com). Code is at https://github.com/peritz/pyovpn-as

## Getting Started

Getting started is simple. First you must enable the XML-RPC feature on your access server. This can be done either through the web interface by navigating to `Configurations -> Client Settings -> Enable Complete API` or by setting it via the command line `./sacli --key "xmlrpc.relay_level" --value 2 ConfigPut`

Now we can start running commands:

```python
>>> from pyovpn_as import client

>>> mgmt_client = client.from_args('https://ovpn.example.org/RPC2/', 'openvpn', 'P4ssw0rd!!!!')

>>> new_user = mgmt_client.users.create_new_user('newuser', 'P4ssw0rd123Â£', prop_superuser=True)

>>> new_user.type

"user_connect"

>>> new_user.is_admin

True

>>> mgmt_client.users.delete_user(as_client, '404')
Traceback (most recent call last):   
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AccessServerProfileNotFoundError: User "404" does not exist
```

## Installation

`pip install pyovpn-as`
