"""Imports the native runtime library.

All code in the runtime should use runtime imports via this module, which
locates the actual _runtime module based on environment configuration.
Currently, we only bundle a single runtime library, but in the future, this
will let us dynamically switch between instrumented, debug, etc by changing
the way this trampoline functions.
