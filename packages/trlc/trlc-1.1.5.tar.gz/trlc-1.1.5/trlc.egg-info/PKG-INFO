# Treat Requirements Like Code (TRLC)
TRLC is a domain-specific language developed at BMW for writing (and
linking) requirements with meta-data.

The repository contains:

* The [language reference
  manual](https://bmw-software-engineering.github.io/trlc/lrm.html)
  for TRLC. [Previous versions](https://github.com/bmw-software-engineering/trlc/blob/main/docs/LRM.md) are also available.

* A pure Python reference implementation of TRLC.

The implementation is not very fast, but designed to be pedantically
correct in following the language definition.  Eventually it will also
contain a powerful linter to find issues with types and check
rules.

The Python implementation can be used for several purposes:

* It can be used to validate other TRLC implementations.

* It can be used to validate a body of requirements (e.g. a CI check
  that all requirements are well formed)

* The API can be used to write other tools based on TRLC (for example
  a tool to render the requirements in HTML, a tool to diff
  requirements or perform an impact analysis, or a tool to perform
  software traceability, etc.)
