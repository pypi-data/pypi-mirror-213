# Terminal Typing Tutor

A port of GNU Typist (GTypist)


## Project Goals

GTypist is by far the best program I have used to learn how to type faster. 
However it is pretty outdated and has many potential features that can be added. 
I was initially going to just add to the C code, but decided to switch to Python for faster implementation.
It is a tradeoff for speed, but so far the difference has not taken away from the program.

I tried to stick with the original program layout and how it did things as much as possible, both out of simplicity and respect to the original.

## Install

pip install --user terminal-typing-tutor

## Usage
in your terminal:

```
$ pip install terminal-typing-tutor
---> 100%
Successfully installed typer

$ ttt
```
## Features

### New

-- So far the only feature I have implemented is tracking all time WPM, and saving scores to ~/.config/terminal-typing-tutor directory
    -- This allows for saving typing scores long-term and between machines. 
    -- I add terminal-typing-tutor to my dotfiles managed by stow so that they are saved to github

### Lacking

-- There are features and also lessons missing from the original GTypist that I don't use.
-- If there is anything you want added, feel free to create and issue or make a pull request, contributions are welcome and encouraged


## License

I stuck with the original license of the project, this is my first real open source project, so please let me know if there are any standards or anything I should do better.
