# Joulescope Driver

Welcome to the Joulescopeâ„¢ Driver project.
[Joulescope](https://www.joulescope.com) is an affordable, precision DC energy
analyzer that enables you to build better products.

This user-space C library communicates with Joulescope products to configure 
operation and receive data.  The first-generation driver introduced in 2019 was
written in Python.  While Python proved to be a very flexible language enabling
many user scripts, it was difficult to support other languages.  
This second-generation driver launched in 2022 addresses several issues
with the first-generation python driver including:

1. Improved event-driven API based upon PubSub for easier integration with 
   user interfaces and other complicated software packages.
2. Improved portability for easier language bindings.
3. Improved performance.

## Building

Ensure that your computer has a development environment including CMake.  


### Windows

Install cmake and your favorite build toolchain such as 
Visual Studio, mingw64, wsl, ninja.

### macOS

For macOS, install homebrew, then:

    brew install pkgconfig python3


### Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

For Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install cmake build-essential ninja-build

### Common

    cd {your/repos/joulescope_driver}
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build . && ctest .

This package includes a command-line tool, jsdrv_util:

    jsdrv_util --help
    jsdrv_util scan


## Python bindings

The python bindings are made to work with Python 3.9 and later.  To install
the dependencies:

    cd {your/repos/joulescope_driver}
    pip3 install -U requirements.txt

You should then be able to build the native bindings:

    python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

On Windows, you may be prompted to install the 
[Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
You may also need to use "python" rather than "python3" on some platforms.

And run the Python tools:

    python3 -m pyjoulescope_driver --help
    python3 -m pyjoulescope_driver scan
    python3 -m pyjoulescope_driver info
    python3 -m pyjoulescope_driver info * --verbose

You may optionally choose to use a Python virtual environment.
