def char_to_surrogates(char: str) -> tuple[int, int]:
    r"""
    Convert one character into 2 integers of its UTF-16 surrogate codepoints.

    A surrogate pair are two characters that represent another character.
    Since UTF-16 only stores characters from 0 to 0xFFFF,
    chars past 0xFFFF need to be split into two codepoints below 0xFFFF.

    This is useful even in plaintext Unicode notation, because ``\u1D105`` is not a single
    character, it's two (``·¥ê5``, not ``ùÑÖ``).

    :param char:
        A single character.
    :returns:
        A surrogate pair, in codepoints of the surrogates.
