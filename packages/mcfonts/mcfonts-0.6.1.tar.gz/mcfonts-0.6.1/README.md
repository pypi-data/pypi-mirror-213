## üì¶ Installation

`mcfonts` is available on PyPI.
It requires a Python version of **at least 3.11.0.**

### "externally-managed-environment"

This error occurs on some Linux distributions such as Fedora 38 and Ubuntu 23.04.
It can be solved by either:

1. Using a [virtual environment (venv)](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)
2. Using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)

    * `space`
    * `bitmap`
    * `legacy_unicode`
    * `ttf`
    * `unihex`
    * `reference`
* Warns of invalid data
* Finds oversights that the Vanilla client does not notice
* Generates optimized and space-saving glyph paths
* Works with any font, not just Vanilla
* Works on fonts with double, triple, or quadruple scales
* Generates summaries of fonts
* Allows easy inspection of a font's details

## üõ† Usage
Using `mcfonts` is simple.

```python
import mcfonts

font = mcfonts.from_java_font_file("path/to/font.json")
# Do stuff with `font`...
```

### Exporting

To export to OpenType:

```python
import mcfonts

font = mcfonts.from_java_font_file("path/to/font.json")
font.export("My cool font").save("My cool font.otf")
```
That's it. Your font is at `./My cool font.otf`.

If you have a font with ~200 characters, it generated in ~0.3 seconds.
<br/>
If you have a font with ~2,000 characters, it generated in ~3.2 seconds.
<br/>
If you have a font with ~13,000 characters, it generated in ~9.9 seconds.
<br/>
If you have a font with ~60,000 characters, you've made a mistake.
<small>(your font generated in ~1 minute, 14 seconds.)</small>

> ‚ùó Note: Only OpenType fonts are supported for exporting.</br>
> Use other utilities such as [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) to convert between formats.

## ‚ùì Why?
### ‚è≥ It's fast

In the time it has taken you to read this sentence,
a font with 1,000 glyphs has already been generated.

A 13,000 glyph font takes 10 seconds.

A simple 100 glyph font? A fraction of a second; it takes 0.1s.

### ‚ûø It's versatile

`mcfonts` works on fonts of any height, ascent, and size.

It correctly compensates & warns about oversized characters,
translucent textures, and invalid data.

### üß† It makes sense

Fonts are organized by a class, instead of using individual functions.

Providers, too, have their own classes.

Exporting and compacting are separated into their own functions, which makes debugging & modification easy.

> **`mcfonts` does not fix mistakes in fonts.**

It will extrapolate missing data, but empty/corrupt textures, invalid numbers,
or extreme cases will result in an error when trying to create a `MinecraftFont` instance with them.

This gives you the ability to correct these problems, instead of silently making them work
(sometimes with limited effectiveness) and keeping you in the dark about future issues.

### üìú It's documented

`mcfonts` has extensive documentation, both externally and in the source code.
Functions are carefully written with rST-style docstrings,
and module variables are given precise descriptions.

## üìí Documentation

Documentation for `mcfonts` is available at https://mcfonts.readthedocs.io.

### Building locally
You can build the documentation yourself by grabbing a copy of the source code:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/whoatemybutter/mcfonts.git
cd mcfonts/docs
```

The documenation has a few requirements, install them all with:
```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run `make html` to begin building the documentation.
It will be at `_build/html/index.html`.
