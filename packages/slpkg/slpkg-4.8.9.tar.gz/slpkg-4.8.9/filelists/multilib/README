Slackware for x86_64 - multilib packages & install instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------

Before proceeding with the installation, it is better to read Eric's instructions.
You will find the file README.ERIC for this purpose, or refer directly to:
http://www.slackware.com/~alien/multilib/

In this folder, there are two lists, as Eric says, you should install first the glibc packages
and then the 32-bit compatibility packages. First, edit the '/etc/slpkg/repositories.toml' file
and enable the 'multilib' repository and then:

  $ slpkg update --bin-repo=multilib

  $ slpkg install glibc_packages.pkgs --reinstall --bin-repo=multilib

  and

  $ slpkg install compat32.pkgs --bin-repo=multilib

Please read README.ERIC for more or visit the site as I say above.

Enjoy!
