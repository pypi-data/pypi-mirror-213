- **Guarantee the highest quality and compliance** by validating all payment
  files to meet the ISO 20022 standards.
- **Provide flexibility and choice to migrate to any supported ISO 20022
  messaging standard definitions** by simplifying the message creation process
  and providing a standardized format for payment files.

## Installation

It takes just a few seconds to get up and running with **Pain001**. Open your
terminal and run the following command:

```sh
pip install pain001
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run **Pain001** directly from the command line.
Simply call the main function with the path of your XML template file, XSD
schema file and the path of your CSV file containing the payment data.

Once you have installed **Pain001**, you can generate and validate XML files
using the following command:

```sh
python3 -m pain001 \
    <xml_message_type> \
    <xml_file_path> \
    <xsd_file_path> \
    <csv_file_path>
```

## Arguments

When running **Pain001**, you will need to specify four arguments:

- `xml_message_type`: This is the type of XML message you want to generate.
  Currently, the valid options are:
  - pain.001.001.03
  - pain.001.001.09
- `xml_file_path`: This is the path to the XML template file you are using.
- `xsd_file_path`: This is the path to the XSD template file you are using.
- `csv_file_path`: This is the path to the CSV data file you want to convert
  to XML.

## Examples

Here are a few example on how to use **Pain001** to generate a
pain.001.001.03 XML file from a CSV data file:

### Via the Command Line

```sh
python3 -m pain001 \
    pain.001.001.03 \
    /path/to/your/pain.001.001.03.xml \
    /path/to/your/pain.001.001.03.xsd \
    /path/to/your/pain.001.001.03.csv
```

**Note:** The XML file that **Pain001** generates will be automatically
validated against the XSD template file before the new XML file is saved. If
the validation fails, **Pain001** will stop running and display an error
message in your terminal.

### Embedded in an Application

To embed **Pain001** in a new or existing application, import the main function
and use it in your code.

Here's an example:

```python
from pain001 import main

if __name__ == '__main__':
  xml_message_type = 'pain.001.001.03'
  xml_file_path = 'template.xml'
  xsd_file_path = 'schema.xsd'
  csv_file_path = 'data.csv'
  main(xml_message_type, xml_file_path, xsd_file_path, csv_file_path)
```

### Validation

To validate the generated XML file against a given xsd schema, use the
following method:

```python
from pain001.core import validate_xml_against_xsd

xml_message_type = 'pain.001.001.03'
xml_file = 'generated.xml'
xsd_file = 'schema.xsd'

is_valid = validate_xml_against_xsd(
  xml_message_type,
  xml_file,
  xsd_file
)
print(f"XML validation result: {is_valid}")
```

### Payment Messages

The following **ISO 20022 Payment Initiation message types** are
currently supported:

- **pain.001.001.03** - Customer Credit Transfer Initiation

This message is used to transmit credit transfer instructions from the
originator (the party initiating the payment) to the originator's bank. The
message supports both bulk and single payment instructions, allowing for the
transmission of multiple payments in a batch or individual payments separately.
The pain.001.001.03 message format is part of the ISO 20022 standard and is
commonly used for SEPA Credit Transfers within the Single Euro Payments Area.
It includes relevant information such as the originator's and beneficiary's
details, payment amounts, payment references, and other transaction-related
information required for processing the credit transfers.

- **pain.001.001.09** - Customer Credit Transfer Initiation

This message format is part of the ISO 20022 standard and is commonly used for
SEPA Credit Transfers within the Single Euro Payments Area. It enables the
transmission of credit transfer instructions from the originator to the
originator's bank. The message includes essential information such as the
originator's and beneficiary's details, payment amounts, payment references,
and other transaction-related information required for processing the credit
transfers.

More message types will be added in the future. Please refer to the section
below for more details.
