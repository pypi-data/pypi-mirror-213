# The [row] and [col] sections specify which conditions are being tested in 
# which wells.  The fields within these sections (e.g. `dilution`, `replicate`) 
# can be anything.  If your plates aren't organized by row and column, there 
# are other ways to define the plate layout; see the "File format" section for
