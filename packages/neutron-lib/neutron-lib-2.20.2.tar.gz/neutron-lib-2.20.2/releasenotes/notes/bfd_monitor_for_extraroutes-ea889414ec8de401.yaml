features:
  - Add possibility to define ``extraroutes`` with ``bfd_monitor``.
    The extension makes it possible to define an ``extraroute`` with
    or without the extra field ``bfd_monitor_id``.
    (``Note`` that this API extension was merged as experimental to enable
    parallel development of multiple backends. At the moment this API does
    not have a reference implementation and should not be considered final.
    A later release note will mark when the reference implementation gets
    merged and the feauture is ready to be consumed.)
