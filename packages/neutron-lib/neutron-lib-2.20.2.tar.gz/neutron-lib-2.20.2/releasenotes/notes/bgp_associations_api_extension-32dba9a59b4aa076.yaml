features:
  - New extension ``bgp_associations`` is included to allow addition of
    router, peer association resources as sub-resources to the existing
    ``bgp-speakers`` resource.
  - Added action ``get_routes`` to the existing bgp extension to list both
    learnt as well as advertised routes by the bgp speaker.
    (``Note`` that this API extension was merged as experimental to enable
    parallel development of multiple backends. At the moment this API does
    not have a reference implementation and should not be considered final.
    A later release note will mark when the reference implementation gets
    merged and the feauture is ready to be consumed.
