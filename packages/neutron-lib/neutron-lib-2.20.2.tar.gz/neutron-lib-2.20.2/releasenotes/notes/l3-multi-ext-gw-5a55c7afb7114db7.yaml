    Definition for API extension: ``multiple-external-gateways``. This API
    definition was merged as experimental to enable parallel development
    of multiple backends. At the moment this API does not have a reference
    implementation and should not be considered final. A later release
    note will mark when the reference implementation gets merged and
    the feauture is ready to be consumed.
