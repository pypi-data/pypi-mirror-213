<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started with PyAIKit, you need to have an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, visit the <a href="https://openai.com">OpenAI website</a> to obtain your API key.</p>

<p>Once you have your API key, you can set it as an environment variable in your project or provide it directly when using PyAIKit.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to generate text using PyAIKit:</p>

<pre><code>from pyaikit.text_summerization.text_summerizer import text_summerizer

openai1=auth.setup(api_key,org_id)
# Instantiate the text_summerizer with your OpenAI API key
generator = text_summerizer()

# Generate text summerization from pdf using the default model
response = generator.summarize_pdf(openai1, no_of_words, file_path, start_page, end_page)

print(response)

<h3>Future Extension Plans for PyAIKit: Enhancing the Power of NLP</h3>
<p>
        PyAIKit is an evolving project with a roadmap of more future extensions and enhancements.
        Here are some of the plans that are being considered to further empower the package:
</p>
<p>
       <b> Model Customization:</b>
        One of the key areas of focus for PyAIKit future development is enabling model customization. This means allowing users to fine-tune the underlying ChatGPT model according to their specific domain or application requirements. Customization options would enable users to train the model on their own data, resulting in more tailored and accurate text generation.
</p>
<p>
        <b> Advanced Text Analysis:</b>
        It aims to provide more advanced text analysis functionalities in the future. This includes features such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentiment analysis. These enhancements would allow users to extract valuable insights from text data, enabling more sophisticated NLP applications and empowering data-driven decision-making.
</p>
<p>
        <b>Integration with Other AI Models:</b>
        This expansion would enable users to combine the power of ChatGPT with other state-of-the-art models, such as image recognition or speech processing models. This integration would enhance the package's versatility and enable the development of more comprehensive AI solutions.</p>
