The goal of **ctbi** is to clean, decompose, impute and aggregate univariate time series. **Ctbi** stands for *Cyclic/Trend decomposition using Bin Interpolation* : the time series is divided into a sequence of non-overlapping bins. The long-term trend is a linear interpolation of the mean values between successive bins and the cyclic component is the mean stack of detrended data within all bins. Outliers present in the residuals are flagged using an enhanced Boxplot rule (called **Logbox**) that is adapted to non-Gaussian data and keeps the type I error at $\frac{0.1}{\sqrt{n}}$ % (percentage of erroneously flagged outliers). Logbox replaces the original 1.5 constant with $A \times \log(n)+B+C/n$. The variable *n* is the sample size, $C = 36$ corrects for biases emerging in small samples, and *A* and *B* are automatically calculated on a predictor of the maximum tail weight. The strength of the cyclic pattern within each bin is quantified by a new metric, the Stacked Cycles Index (SCI), with SCI ~ 0 associated with no cyclicity and SCI = 1 a perfectly cyclic signal.
