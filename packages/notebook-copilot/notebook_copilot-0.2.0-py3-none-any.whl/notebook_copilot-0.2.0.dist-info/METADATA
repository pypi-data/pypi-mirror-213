# 🚀 Notebook Copilot: Turn Your Thoughts Into a Polished Notebook at Record-Speed with AI.

Welcome to Notebook Copilot, your next-generation tool for Jupyter Notebooks. Inspired by GitHub Copilot, Notebook
Copilot is designed to help data scientists and engineers in developing professional, high-quality notebooks. It's like
having your personal AI-powered assistant that helps you navigate through the Jupyter universe, seamlessly
generating code and markdown cells based on your inputs.

Imagine not having to start with a blank notebook every time. Sounds dreamy, right?

## Features

- 🚀 GPT Based Generation: Notebook Copilot employs advanced GPT instances for precise and efficient code generation.
- 💻 Integrated with Any Notebook Environments: Seamless access within Jupyter Notebook and other popular platforms, boosting your productivity.
- 🧩 Automatic Context Retrieval: Understands the full context of your notebook, ensuring consistent and relevant code generation.
- 🔑 Bring Your Own Key: Flexibility to use your own OpenAI key for personalized code generation and optimal results.
- 🆓 Free and Open Source: Everyone can benefit from Notebook Copilot. It's our contribution to the coding community, aiming to make coding accessible, efficient, and fun.

## Quickstart
```python
!pip install notebook_copilot
%load_ext notebook_copilot
```
```python
%copilot
```



## Walk-through
0. Get an OpenAI [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
1. Install Notebook Copilot directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install notebook_copilot
```

2. Load the Notebook Copilot extension in your Jupyter notebook:

```python
%load_ext notebook_copilot

# Optional: If you don't have OPENAI_API_KEY set in your environment, you can set it here
from getpass import getpass
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass("Enter your OpenAI Key: ")
```

3. Start using Notebook Copilot Magic Functions in your notebook ↓


## ✨ Magic Functions

🪄 Enter Assistant Mode and let Copilot continuously generate professional code and markdown cells for you.
```python
%copilot
```

✍️ Leverage AI to create the next cell from your comments. It's like having a conversation with your notebook.

```python
%%code 
# Plot the confusion matrix for each model
# Plot the precision-recall curve for Catboost
```

📘 Automatically generate markdown cells to explain the code in the current cell. Your code is now not only functional but also well-documented.
```python
%%explain
# some code to explain…
```

⚡ Improve the time complexity of the code in no time. Copilot will generate an alternative code cell that is optimized for speed.
```python
%%optimize
# a code cell…
```

🎨 1 plot >= 1000 data rows. Visualize your data with a single line of code.
```python
%%visualize
# a code cell…
```
