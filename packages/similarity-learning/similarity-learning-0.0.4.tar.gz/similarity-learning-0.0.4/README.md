## Install

``` sh
pip install similarity_learning
```

## How to use

As an nbdev library, `similarity_learning` supports `import *` (without
importing unwanted symbols):

``` python
from similarity_learning.all import *
```

Now we can train a pair-matcher. First let’s construct dataloaders of
pairs:

``` python
from fastai.vision.all import *
```

``` python
pairs = Pairs(Imagenette(160), .1)
dls = pairs.dls(after_item=Resize(128),
                after_batch=Normalize.from_stats(*imagenet_stats))
```

To get quick results, we can use the body of a pretrained model as a
backbone for our Siamese neural network:

``` python
classifier = resnet34(weights=ResNet34_Weights.DEFAULT)
siamese = ThresholdSiamese(create_body(model=classifier, cut=-1)).to(dls.device)
siamese.fit_threshold(dls.train)
```

    (1.0099999904632568, 0.8962054252624512)

Let’s see how good it is:

``` python
learn = Learner(dls, siamese, metrics=accuracy)
learn.validate()
```

``` python
learn.show_results()
```

Not bad, but we can do better with finetuning:

``` python
learn.fit(5, 1e-4)
learn.validate()
```

``` python
learn.show_results()
```

We can also consider the distribution of feature-space distances
compared to the decision threshold:

``` python
siamese.plot_distance_histogram(dls.valid)
```

visualizations, comparison of loss functions, and facial recognition.
