	Welcome to FTP.FUNET.FI aka NIC.FUNET.FI aka BIO.NIC.FUNET.FI 

It runs on two Linux servers with dual 20 core processors, 
786GB of memory and 2 x 25Gbit/s network connections.
80+ TiB storage is provided from NetApp NFS NAS servers.


This system is owned by the finnish ministry of education
and operated on their behalf by CSC primarily for the Finnish Academic
and Research Network FUNET users and the Elixir Community. 
It is located in the town of Espoo in Finland.

    This server group has many names.  Its "staff" will always be
at `nic.funet.fi', but othervice consider using philosophy: `name by
function', thus FTP from  ftp.funet.fi.

ftp.funet.fi         traditional anonymous ftp service (also with http and IPv6 support)
www.nic.funet.fi     http access to our collections (shows index.html's if any)
nic.funet.fi	     email and other administrative tasks (in practice ftp
		     is also supported)
rsync.nic.funet.fi   rsync protocol for bulk downloads
bio.nic.funet.fi     bioinformatics data and software 
kernel.nic.funet.fi  Linux kernel which originated from here


We have also several other names and may move some services to other
computers as we see necessary.

	INTRO:

    This system has plenty of freely distributable material on its FTPable
areas.   We have also other services, see at the end of this document for
pointers.

    If you have any questions regarding MATERIALS in this archive, read
first `Contacts about material in here' below.  If you can't locate correct
person/mail alias with it, try `problems@nic.funet.fi', but do not do that
as your only attempt!


	WHAT IS CONSIDERED A PROPER CONDUCT OF ANONYMOUS FTP USAGE:

    Like many systems world wide, ours offers  anonymous  logins for
FTP users.  Such a service means:
	- You do not need to apply an account at this server, just use
	  well known userid:   anonymous  (or ftp)  and for a password please 
          do enter your email address (in format:  your_userid@your_site)
          according to the convention used since the 1970s in public FTP servers.

	- While this service is called "anonymous" due to that well-known
	  userid, it is considered good manners to identify yourself
	  properly.  (No, this is not truly anonymous.)
	(See PRIVACY ISSUES)

For those who have this privilege of using ftp, here are some do's
and don'ts:

      - When you are transferring large amounts over long distance
	links, do limit yourself to off hours.  When working between
	the USA and Finland, try it after 4 PM OUR time ( 10 AM
	Eastern USA time.)  And remember that we wake up 10 hours
	before California.  We are at time zone `UTC +2h' and in
	summer 'UTC +3h'

      - Major portion material in this archive originates from various
	locations all over the world. We try to indicate origins 
        if we know them. Do try to use server nearest (network wise) to
        yourself.

      - When you log in anonymous, system immediately identifies you, and
	if you are not limited by number of users, you are
	prompted with:

	331 Any password will work

	Alternatively, read the man-page of ftp-program (assuming you
	are using UNIX ftp client), and see what is said about ".netrc" 
        or other ways of setting presets.

      - See below more about what is `Freely Distributable'.
	After all, it is not always the same as Public Domain!

      - Don't do many parallel downloads, it will slow down the
	service for others and eventually even you. There's a maximum limit
        on simultaneous connections for FTP which is shown when you log in. 
        For HTTP we have had to limit the maximum connections from one
        IP to 10. 


      - REMEMBER: USING ANONYMOUS FTP IS A PRIVILEGE.  DON'T ABUSE IT!



	PRIVACY ISSUES

    All file accesses, logins etc. are logged with time, userid (if
available), URL, IP-address, client type and version, referer, size of transfer, sessionid
etc. and the logs are kept as long as it's needed to satisfy statistical,
security and legislative requirements.  We don't transfer log
information outside EU or give them to third parties for advertising.

There may however be some, possibly mirrored, HTML files or links that
point to external content like HTML, images or javascript from third
party servers beyond our control which may have their own logging
policies.  These pages may or may not have their own privacy
documentation links.  Please check the HTML page source code or use
suitable tools to check any external content in case you are
concerned. Or you can always use good old FTP for browsing and
downloading the files you want without worrying what external things
some web pages may contain. FTP is logged only locally.

 The plain directory listings are generated by apache directory
module which may display header or footer HTML files if they exist in the
directory. E.g. some linux distributions use them to provide additional information.

If you want to be totally unknown, you must not use FTP, WWW, Rsync or
other internet services as it can never be used without revealing at least the
IP address of the host or firewall your connection is coming from.  Even if you
had a firewall or proxy somewhere in between, they often keep track
who's using them.  

The public FTP use is anonymous, which means that you can give any
userid you wish and if it's unknown locally, you will be logged in to
the public FTP repository and we'll log just your IP under userid ftp
along with the information of the transferred files like
name, datetime, sessionid, duration and size of the transfer.  It's
however customary to use as usernames either ftp or
anonymous. Password can be anything. 

For more information on the FTP server and it's log formats please read

https://download.pureftpd.org/pub/pure-ftpd/doc/README

Use of public web services doesn't normally require login or userid but
we collect the usual web logs that apache produces, 
information on what might be collected is in it's documentation

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html

Use of public rsync is provided without logins. Rsync server logs
IP-address, domain name, datetime, requests, transferred filenames, bytes, 
possible errors, session id etc. 

For more information please read the source code available at 

http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/samba.org/pub/rsync/

For administrative and other restricted services like ssh and gridftp we usually 
require logins that we do log along with personally identifiable userid or
certificate information and handle according to our privacy policies.

For more information on privacy related information can be found at
https://www.csc.fi/privacy. It includes information on 
CSC's Customer Register Privacy Policy and contact information for
privacy related issues.

For statistics we may use the domain part of your hostname, not the
hostname itself which in practice means organization and country level
statistics which we need to maintain the service and it's
funding. Please try to keep your reverse DNS working, especially if
you are under .fi domain since we will try to give preference to
finnish users in case we will someday again have to impose domain
based speed restrictions on the service like in the early days of the
Internet.

We may also use log information to analyze and prevent possible
missuse of our resources. We may for example limit the usage from
certain IP addresses or domains if they cause unnecessary load or
other issues for the service.  Also access to certain files,
directories, web-pages and applications may be limited and monitored.
In case of possible abuse we may also try to use the IP address
registries to contact your network administration via the Funet CERT.



	CONTACTS ABOUT MATERIAL IN HERE:

Most of the active content is originated from some other site, please
contact them, not us for questions or contributions.  E.g. if pwd says
that in the path is a directory /mirrors/ then it's clearly not
originating from us.  Name of the mirror origin can usually be deduced
from the directory name under /pub/mirrors/

If you can't figure out the origin of the content, then
please use the contact form at https://www.nic.funet.fi/contact to
contact the NIC.FUNET.FI coordinator or use the traditional 
contact information in the beginning of this file.



	UPLOADING:

If you want to upload or contribute some files for
publication, please contact the NIC.FUNET.FI coordinator for
more information. Be prepared to proof your identity, the origin
of the content and permissions required for distributing the content.

If an area is no longer actively maintained, we don't normally accept
new contributions unless there's a good reason and clear documentation.
Those areas are mainly preserved for their possible historical value.

If you still can't figure out what to do you can contact the NIC.FUNET.FI coordinator
with all relevant informations concerning your case.




	CD-ROMs

    Every now and then we are asked for a CD-ROM of this archive; so far
there are none available with the exception of the Euroscene 1 collection
based on part of the Amiga area. We don't expect many exceptions...

    Reasons for this are multiple, not the least of them being our
unwillingess to do the effort of publishing such a set.  Arranging the
publishing on this kind of directly government funded system is not so
easy in legal wise when it comes to direct money making as of selling
those CD-ROMs... Also it doesn't too well fit to our main business
idea of providing all the WAN network services the Academic and
Research community needs. The whole archive on CD-ROM would take 
thousands of CD-ROMs and require lots of manpower to figure out what
should or shouldn't be on each cd-rom and how to finance it. We are a
network service provider, not a cd-rom store.

Some software collections are available commercially, with technical
support, on CD-ROM from other sources (e.g. most Linux distributions). That
may even be a major revenue source for maintaining those collections
so they might not even allow cd-rom versions by others. Some other
collections however are specifically available as CD-ROM images (.iso)
that you can burn yourself and even distribute according to their
copyright statements. So please read the fine print before
redistributing collections available from us. 

	FTPD SOURCES:


For a simple to maintain ftp server, you might want to
look at www.pureftpd.org, we have used it successfully in several
different places.  Another Very Secure choice might be vsftpd
available from http://vsftpd.beasts.org that is being used by many large
sites.




	REPORTING A BUG:

    If you observe odd behaviour of this server, which is not of what you
believe to be correct, please contact   problems@ftp.funet.fi  and in the
report have attached a session log which shows the wrong functionality.
However, check at first what we state about "Restrictions" below!

Such log should start from your FTP session startup, and it should contain:

	- Descriptions about your (computing-) environment relevant
	  with attempted FTP access;
		- Maker and model of the computer where you ran your
		  FTP session,
		- TCP/IP software model and maker (quite many system do
		  not come with builtin TCP/IP -- VMS-machines are one
		  such example.)
	- UNEDITED (verbose, unabridged) session transcript showing
	  EVERYTHING you sent to this system, and what were the responses.

Note: Reports about corrupted files belong to archive area keepers; they
      handle those files;  "problems"  handles the server subsystem.


    Bugs/problems relating to ARCHIVED MATERIAL:
	Select by list under: `Contacts about material in here'

    Bugs/problems relating to other parts of system software:
	Problems group:  <problems@ftp.funet.fi>
	("system software" does not mean anything under /pub/")

	If you can get /README without trouble, don't contact <problems>,
	but one of earlier mentioned area administration aliases.



	WHAT IS `FREELY DISTRIBUTABLE' ?

	Freely distributable does not mean the same thing as PD
(public domain).  A big portion of the software available here is not
in the public domain, although it is freely distributable.  Many are
copyrighted by some person or organization, but can be distributed
freely; there may be limitations on the manner of distribution and/or
the usage of the programs.  There may also be certain rules concerning
the distribution of modified versions (derivate work) of the programs,
like saying that if you redistribute a modified version you must
include in the distribution the date and author of the modification.
Also on many programs you must include a note crediting the original
author of the program if you use his code in your own programs.

	An example of this is the Free Software Foundation's GNU
software.  GNU software may be distributed freely, provided that the
sources are included, an offer to distribute the sources is included
or that a pointer to where the sources can be gotten from is included.
On  FTP.FUNET.FI,  all the GNU source code published is available from
the directory  pub/gnu.   Some GNU binaries are available from other
directories as well; although we have tried to include a pointer to
the sources and the copyright information in these other directories,
too, it might be that we have neglected some.  This note is here to
point you to the sources in  pub/gnu.   For further information, the
GNU copyright is in the file  pub/gnu/COPYING.

Take also in account the provisions of the european GDPR directives
and document appropriately. If the material contains information that
could be used to identify persons please make sure that the
information is freely distributable. Also if you have many such
entries, you may need to declare it as a registry of persons and make
sure that the persons in question don't object in being such a
registry (e.g. list of contacts, authors or references in documents or
mailing list archives etc. also may constitute a registry and not just
a formal database.




We have multiple filesystems that are all mounted via mountpoints under
the /.m/ directory. We may move mirrors and other directories from
one filesystem to another without notice, so please refer to our directories
with the official /pub/ or /index/ path instead of the physical /.m they
map to and might be shown to you by various user agents. Especially all
/.m/mirror*/ filesystems are all symlinked via the /pub/mirrors/ directory
and the subdirectories try to match those on the original site.




A very concise history of NIC
=============================

1988 First of December Finland gets it's first internet link of 56Kbit/s via the NORDUnet co-operation and major part of the traffic was from FTP
1989 Funet saw the need for a FTP-server that would allow better access to the internet content (web was still a dream)
     from Finland. Decision to set up NIC.FUNET.FI was made and Request for Proposals sent out
1990 First NIC.FUNET.FI, a SUN 4/330, with dual 40Mhz SPARC processors, 128MB RAM and 6GB of usable
     disk space which made it then among the largest FTP servers in the Internet. 
     Our international internet connectivity for whole Funet was 64Kbit/s so mea develops an ftpd with speed limits
     More hardware details are available in /pub/files/Historical/staff-docs/historical/First-NIC-Hardware.txt
1991 Linus Torvalds offered a small OS for public distribution which our volunteer 
     Ari Lemmke decided to call Linux and the name stuck... International connection was upgraded to 128Kbit/s
1992 We had about 20GB of external disks and a motherboard upgrade making it in practice a SUN 630-41 MP
     International connectivity was upgraded to 1Mbit/s
1994 Second NIC with 275Mhz Alpha processor, 320MB of memory and 100GB+ disk space (DEC AXP3000-900)
     International connection for Funet upgraded to 2 x 2Mbit/s
1999 Third NIC with four processors and 4GB of memory (a SUN 450) was taken in use. 
     Under 1TB made from well over hunred old and new disks in two RAID racks (DEC and Eurologic)
     International connections used 155Mbit/s links with redundancy
2003 A user survey to determine whether users still need NIC is made with an encouraging response
2006 The fourth version of NIC from Fujitsu-Siemens Computers with 16GB of memory and four processors
     is taken into production initially with 3TB+ EMC CX300 SAN storage array. A SUN V240 is in a support role.
     2.5Gbit/s and 10Gbit/s international links
2007 5-6 TB SAN storage added. Dark fibers with support for many lightpaths deployed in the Funet backbone.
2010 Fifth version of NIC, a Dell R710, with dual Quad-Core Nehalem EP (2,53Ghz Intel Xeon 5540) processors, 
     72GB of RAM and storage from the CSC storage area network (initially 10TB+ from a EMC CX700) 
     taken into use under Solaris 10 and the ZFS filesystem. Network connection is now 
     10Gbit/s to the Funet backbone and multiples of 10Gbit/s to the rest of the Internet.
2012 bio.nic.funet.fi R710 servers and NetApp storage added to the NIC.FUNET.FI to primarily serve Elixir bioinformatics community
2019 Sixth version of (bio)NIC, two Dell R640 servers with 2 x 20 core processors and 786GB of memory each. 80+TB of NetApp NFS storage.

More historical pieces of information can be found in various files around NIC and especially a more
generic Internet-history in a concise web format at http://www.nic.funet.fi/index/FUNET/history/internet/

There's also a more verbose article of NIC now and then at the CSCnews 3/06 available at
https://web.archive.org/web/20070107152338/http://www.csc.fi/csc/julkaisut/CSCnews/Edelliset_numerot/CSCnews3_2006
