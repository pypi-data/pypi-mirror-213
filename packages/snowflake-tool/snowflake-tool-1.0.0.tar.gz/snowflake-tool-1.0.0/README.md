# Snowflake-tool
Snowflake tool is a Python library that implements the Snowflake algorithm and is used to generate Snowflake ID.

The default Twitter format shown below.

```text
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1 Bit Unused | 41 Bit Timestamp |  10 Bit Machine ID  |   12 Bit Sequence ID |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
## Install

```shell
pip install snowflake-tool
```

## Usage

```python
from snowflake import Snowflake

gen = Snowflake(1)
for i in range(int(1e5)):
    print(next(gen))
```

Of course, you could also generate one id by generator:

```python
from snowflake import Snowflake

gen = Snowflake(1)
print(gen.generate())
```
