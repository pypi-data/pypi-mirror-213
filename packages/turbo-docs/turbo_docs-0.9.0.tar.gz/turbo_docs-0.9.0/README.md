# Turbo Docs

Turbo Docs is a Python tool designed to help developers generate a well-formatted README.md file for their repository and perform other tasks related to gathering information from their codebase.

## Installation

You can install Turbo Docs using pip:

```bash
pip install turbo_docs
```

## Usage

Turbo Docs provides command line options for various tasks, such as generating a README.md file, or copying the formatted directory text to the clipboard. To use Turbo Docs, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
turbo_docs [options]
```

### Available Options

- `--copy`: Copy the formatted text of the entire directory to clipboard. This can be useful when working with GPT. Example:

  ```
  turbo_docs --copy
  ```

- `--readme`: Generate a well-formatted README.md file for the repository. Example:

  ```
  turbo_docs --readme
  ```

## Configuration

To configure Turbo Docs, create a `turbo_docs.toml` file in the root of your project and specify the files and directories to ignore. The following example shows how to exclude different types of files and directories:

```toml
ignore = 
    "__pycache__",
    "venv",
    "build",
    "dist",
    "*.egg-info",
    ".git",
    "README.md",  # This is recommended so that --readme doesn't include the readme file itself
]
```
