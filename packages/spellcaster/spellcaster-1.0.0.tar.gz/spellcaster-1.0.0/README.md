# Take control of Python with ease with the legendary Spellcaster!

Spellcaster is a module programmed by Omer DrkiÄ‡ that adds loads of new features and makes Python easier to use. The module adds some features that the developer felt like they were missing from Python. It adds some extension to the standard Python environment as well as some useful data manipulation tools.

## History

Spellcaster was first created in 2022 for personal use, but now the developer has decided to recreate it even better and finally upload it to PyPI. Fun fact: the original name was actually Pynamic, but the developer found out that there was already a module named Pynamic on PyPI.

## Examples

The more detailed documentation on how to use Spellcaster can be found on [this link](https://bytewizarddocs.github.io/spellcaster), but here are some of the most important and notable functions.

### `clear()`

The `clear` function is added to make clearing the console output easier and quicker and it has no parameters at all.

### `wait(interval)`

The `wait` function makes pausing the program quicker and it has only one parameter, the interval to pause the program for in seconds. For example, `wait(3)` makes the program wait for three seconds.

### `random(min, max)`

The `random` function generates true random floating numbers and requires two parameters, the minimum value and the maximum value. It includes both ends during generation. For example, `random(3.2, 5)` generates a float between 3.2 and 5.

### `choose(*values)`

The `choose` function returns a randomly chosen item from the specified list which can have as many items. For example, `choose("apple", "banana", "pear")` will return either "apple", "banana", or "pear".
