## :space_invader: About

This code is implementing the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. It iterates through the array and compares adjacent elements, swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the array is sorted. The main function is a test case that calls the `bubble_sort` function with an example array and prints the sorted result.
