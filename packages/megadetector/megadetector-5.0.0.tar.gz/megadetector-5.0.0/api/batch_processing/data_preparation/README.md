# Overview

This folder contains scripts and notebooks for running batches of images through MegaDetector, including separating batches into chunks, verifying the output, postprocessing, etc.  I don't usually break the fourth wall in documentation, but this is Dan writing this sentence, and [manage_local_batch.py](manage_local_batch.py) is how I run MegaDetector 100% of the time.  I do that in [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), but most people would do the same thing in Jupyter notebooks, so I also maintain a [notebook](manage_local_batch.ipynb) with exactly the same content.

See [here](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector/blob/main/megadetector.md#ok-but-is-that-how-the-md-devs-run-the-model) for more information on what this notebook does.
