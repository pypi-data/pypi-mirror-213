# Experimental project file that uses Poetry to build.  Works conceptually, but
# is not practical because of this issue, which requires poetry to download
# lots of PyTorch wheels to figure out the right version:
#
# https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/6409
#
# This will probably be moot after upgrading to PyTorch 2.0+.
#
# Notes to self:
#
# mamba create -n md-poetry-test python=3.9.16 -y
# mamba activate md-poetry-test
# mamba install poetry -y
# poetry install -vvv
# poetry cache:clear pypi --all
