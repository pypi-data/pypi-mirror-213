# Experimental project file that uses Hatchling to build, and uses the hatch-requirements-txt
# plugin to push the dependency list out to a requirements.txt file.  Works conceptually, but 
# getting the right version of PyTorch installed is difficult, because I need to point to a source
# other than PyPI, and I can't figure out how to do that with Hatchling and/or hatch-requirements-txt.
#
# This will likely become moot after upgrading to PyTorch 2.0+.
#
# Notes to self:
#
# mamba create -n md-hatch-test python=3.9.16 -y
# mamba activate md-hatch-test
#
# mamba create -n md-pip-test python=3.9.16 -y
# mamba activate md-pip-test
# pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ megadetector==5.0.0
# pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ megadetector==5.0.0 --no-deps
