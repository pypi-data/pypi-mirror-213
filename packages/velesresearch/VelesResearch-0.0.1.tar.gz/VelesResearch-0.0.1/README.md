Veles is a free and open source research tool, primarly for social scientists. It's goal is to provide an interface for surveys and chronometric experiments. It combines the power of Survey.js and PsychoPy (PsychJS) to create self contained units that can be self-hosted. Veles' own web service for creating and hosting experiments is planned.

Veles is in pre-alpha development, but the goal features are:

- Free and open source.

- Text-based with optional GUI.

- Integration with GitHub.

- Ability to use JavaScript and CSS drectly.

- Syntax highlighting.

- Open source documentation.

- Collaboration features.

- VS code extension pack.

- Custom redirection in the end (for panels).

- PsychoPy integration?

- Real logs and debug window with variables.

- Real time JavaScript code preview.

- Modifiable themes.
