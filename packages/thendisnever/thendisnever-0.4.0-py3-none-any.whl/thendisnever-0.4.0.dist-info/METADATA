# The End is Never

A package to make an LLM talk with itself for eternity.

```python
from thendisnever.thend import isnever
isnever(
  model_name='Fredithefish/ScarletPajama-3B-HF', # Default LLM
  prompt='THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER ', # Default prompt
  max_memory_ratio=0.5 # Default % of latest tokens to remember, 0 < % < 1
)
```

## Notes

- When running `isnever()` for the first time, it will download the model and tokenizer from HuggingFace. This will take a while, but it only needs to be done once.
- If you want to use the CPU (not recommended because it's slow, but it works), make sure you have [PyTorch for CPU](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installed.
