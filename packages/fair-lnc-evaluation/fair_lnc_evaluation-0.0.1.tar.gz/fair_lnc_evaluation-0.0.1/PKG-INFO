# Systematic analysis of the impact of label noise correction on ML Fairness

This Python package provides an implementation of the empirical methodology to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of label noise correction techniques in ensuring the fairness of models trained on biased datasets, proposed in [1]. The methodology involves manipulating the amount of label noise and can be used with fairness benchmarks but also with standard ML datasets. Experiment tracking is done using `mlflow`.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip`:

```shell
pip install fair_lnc_evaluation
```

## Usage

Examples of how to use this package can be found on the `examples` folder.
