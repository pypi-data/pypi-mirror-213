ipproxy is a tool for obtaining and managing proxy IPs in Python. 
It can help crawler programs hide their real IP addresses when accessing target websites, thereby avoiding being 
blocked or restricted. 
Typically, ipproxy will obtain proxy IPs from some free or paid proxy IP websites, and filter and verify these proxy 
IPs to ensure their availability and stability. 
Then, ipproxy will store these available proxy IPs in a pool and provide API interfaces or other methods for crawler 
programs to use. 
There are many ways to implement ipproxy in Python, such as using multi-threading, multi-processing, coroutines, etc. 
to improve efficiency and stability. At the same time, ipproxy also needs to consider factors such as the availability, 
stability, and anonymity of proxy IPs to ensure the normal operation of crawler programs.
