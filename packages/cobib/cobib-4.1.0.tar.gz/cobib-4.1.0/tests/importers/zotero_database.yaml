  abstract: In the near future, material and drug design may be aided by quantum computer
    assisted simulations. These have the potential to target chemical systems intractable
    by the most powerful classical computers. However, the resources offered by contemporary
    quantum computers are still limited, restricting the chemical simulations to very
    simple molecules. In order to rapidly scale up to more interesting molecular systems,
    we propose the embedding of the quantum electronic structure calculation into
    a classically computed environment obtained at the Hartree-Fock ({HF}) or Density
    Functional Theory ({DFT}) level of theory. We achieve this by constructing an
    effective Hamiltonian that incorporates a mean field potential describing the
    action of the inactive electrons on a selected Active Space ({AS}). The ground
    state of the {AS} Hamiltonian is determined by means of the Variational Quantum
    Eigensolver ({VQE}) algorithm. With the proposed iterative {DFT} embedding scheme
    we are able to obtain energy correction terms for a single pyridine molecule that
    outperform the Complete Active Space Self Consistent Field ({CASSCF}) results
    regardless of the chosen {AS}.
