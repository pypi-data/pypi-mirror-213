23.1.0 (June 14, 2023)
======================
A new minor release featuring the new individual reports built with the new
*NiReports* VRS (visual reports system). This means *MRIQC* now uses the same
package *fMRIPrep* uses for generating its reports. In addition to that,
this new release also features *Beta* support for diffusion MRI (dMRI).
