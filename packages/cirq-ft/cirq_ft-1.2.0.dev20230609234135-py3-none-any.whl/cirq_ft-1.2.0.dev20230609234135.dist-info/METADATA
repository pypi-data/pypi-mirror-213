TODO(#6119,tanujkhattar): please review and update as needed

Cirq is a Python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum
circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.

This module is **cirq-ft**, which enhances support for fault-tolerant algorithms
and provides functions for quantum memory management.

Installation
------------

To install the stable version of only **cirq-ft**, use `pip install cirq-ft`.
To install the pre-release version of only **cirq-ft**, use `pip install cirq-ft --pre`.

Note, that this will install both cirq-ft and cirq-core as well.

To get all the optional modules installed as well, you'll have to use `pip install cirq` or
`pip install cirq --pre` for the pre-release version.
