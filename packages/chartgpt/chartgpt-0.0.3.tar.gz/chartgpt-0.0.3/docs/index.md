# ChartGPT

ChartGPT is a Python library that leverages the power of GPT to generate Plotly charts from a pandas dataframe with a very simple prompt. Ask it anything, and it will generate a chart for you.

It provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for creating visually appealing and interactive charts, making data visualization a breeze.

## Installation

To install ChartGPT, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install chartgpt
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using ChartGPT in your Python projects. Here's an example of how to use it:

```Python
from chartgpt import ChartGPT
cg = ChartGPT()
cg.load(df)
cg.plot("State vs. Population")
```

The above code snippet demonstrates the basic usage of ChartGPT. Let's break it down:

1. Import the `ChartGPT` class from the `cg` module.
2. Create an instance of `ChartGPT` using `cg = ChartGPT()`.
3. Load `df` into ChartGPT.
4. Ask ChartGPT to plot the chart with your specific instructions. The model will do the rest ðŸ˜‰
