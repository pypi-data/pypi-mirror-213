mahirodos2 is a Python package that provides a simple yet powerful capability to perform DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks. Please note that launching DoS attacks is illegal and unethical unless you have explicit permission from the target site's owner and are using it for legitimate purposes such as security testing. It's important to use such tools responsibly and within the boundaries of the law.
