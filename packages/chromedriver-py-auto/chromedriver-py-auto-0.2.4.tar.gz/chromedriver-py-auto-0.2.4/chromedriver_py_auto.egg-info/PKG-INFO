Description: # chromdriver-py-auto
        A wrapper around [chromedriver-py](https://github.com/breuerfelix/chromedriver-py)
        library. Detects the Chrome version and installs the most suitable
        [chromedriver-py](https://github.com/breuerfelix/chromedriver-py) version.
        
        
        ## Installation
        Just run the following command:
        
        ```bash
        pip install chromedriver-py-auto
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Even though this library installs the
        [chromedriver-py](https://github.com/breuerfelix/chromedriver-py) itself, but some
        build systems (such as [Pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants)) create different
        isolated environments for setup and running, so, the dependencies installed in setup
        time got removed at runtime. For this reason, I copied actual driver binary to the
        `chromedriver_py_auto` package at setup time. Therefore, in addition to the method
        presented in
        [chromedriver-py#usage](https://github.com/breuerfelix/chromedriver-py#usage), the
        copied binary can be used as follow:
        
        ```python
        from chromedriver_py_auto import binary_path
        ...
        ```
