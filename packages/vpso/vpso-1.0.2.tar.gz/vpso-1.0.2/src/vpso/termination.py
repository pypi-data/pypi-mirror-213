    Parameters
    ----------
    sx : 3d array
        Social best, i.e., the best particle so far. An array of shape `(N, 1, d)`,
        where `N` is the number of vectorized problems to solve simultaneously, and `d`
        is the dimension of the search space.
    sf : 1d array
        Social best value. An array of shape `(N,)`.
    sx_new : 3d array
        The new social best at the next iteration. An array of shape `(N, 1, d)`.
    sf_new : 1d array
        The new social best value at the next iteration. An array of shape `(N,)`.
    lb : 3d array
        Lower bound of the search space. An array of shape `(N, 1, d)`.
    ub : 3d array
        Upper bound of the search space. An array of shape `(N, 1, d)`.
    xtol : 1d array
        Tolerance for average changes in the objective minimizer before terminating the
        solver. An array of shape `(N,)`.
    ftol : 1d array
        Number of iterations to wait before terminating the solver if no improvement is
        witnessed. An array of shape `(N,)`.
    current_patience_level : Array2i
        Current patience level, i.e., for how many iterations the tolerances have been
        met. An array of shape `(N, 2)`, where the first column corresponds to the
        tolerance in `x`, and the second column in `f`. This array is modified in-place.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of 1d arrays
        Returns the current termination criteria for `x` and `f`, respectively.
