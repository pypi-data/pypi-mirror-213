Reproducing viridis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Load `viridis AKA option_d.py <https://github.com/BIDS/colormap/>`__ using::

  viscm --uniform-space buggy-CAM02-UCS -m Bezier edit /tmp/option_d.py

Note that there was a small bug in the assumed sRGB viewing conditions
while designing viridis. It does not affect the outcome by much. Also
see :code:`viscm --help`.
