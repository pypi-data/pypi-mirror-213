*Current version:* 0.1.1

Spectrally-regularised-LVMs is a Python-based package which facilitates the estimation of the linear latent variable model (LVM) parameters with a unique spectral regularisation term in single channel time-series applications.

## Purpose
LVMs are a statistical methodology which tries to capture the underlying structure in some observed data. This package caters to single channel time-series applications and provides a methodology to estimate the LVM parameters. The model parameters are encouraged to be diverse via a spectral regularisation which penalises source duplication of the spectral information captured by the latent sources.

The purpose of this package is to provide a complete methodology that caters to a variety of LVM objective functions.

# API usage

## Model parameter estimation
A generic example is shown below:
```python
import spectrally_regularised_LVMs as srLVMs

# Load in some data
signal_data = ... # Load a single channel time-series signal
Fs = ... # Sampling frequency of the data

# Hankelise the data
X = srLVMs.hankel_matrix(signal_data,
                          Lw = 512,
                          Lsft = 1)

# Define a cost function for latent sources with maximum variance
cost_inst = srLVMs.VarianceCost()

# Define a model instance
model_inst = srLVMs.LinearModel(n_sources=10,
                                 cost_instance=cost_inst,
                                 whiten=False,
                                 alpha_reg=1.0)

# Estimate the model parameters
model_inst.fit(X, Fs = Fs)
```

## Cost function implementation
This package allows users to implement their own objective functions. Two examples are shown here.

### Method one - user defined

This method allows users to implement their objective function and all required higher order derivatives manually. This is demonstrated through:
```python
import numpy as np
import spectrally_regularised_LVMs as srLVMs

# Define objective function (maximise source variance)
def cost(X, w, y):

    return -1 * np.mean((X @ w) ** 2, axis=0) # Framework performs minimisation

# Define gradient vector
def grad(X, w, y):

    return -2 * np.mean(y * X, axis=0, keepdims=True).T

# Define Hessian matrix
def hess(X, w, y):

    return -2 * np.cov(X, rowvar=False)

# Initialise the cost instance
user_cost = srLVMs.UserCost(use_hessian = True)

# Define the objective function, gradient and Hessian
user_cost.set_cost(cost)
user_cost.set_gradient(grad)
user_cost.set_hessian(hess)

# Check the implementation
X_ = np.random.randn(1000, 16)
w_ = np.random.randn(16, 1)
y_ = X_ @ w_

res_grad = user_cost.check_gradient(X_, w_, y_,step_size = 1e-4)
res_hess = user_cost.check_hessian(X_, w_, y_,step_size = 1e-4)
```

### Method two - SymPy defined
Users can also use [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) to implement their objective function, which allows for all higher order derivatives to be obtained symbolically. An example of this is given through
```python
import sympy as sp
import numpy as np
import spectrally_regularised_LVMs as srLVMs

n_samples = 1000 # Fix the number of samples in the data
n_features = 16 # Fix the number of features

# Initialise the cost function instance
user_cost = srLVMs.SympyCost(n_samples, n_features, use_hessian=True)

# Get the SymPy representations of the model parameters
X_sp, w_sp, iter_params = user_cost.get_model_parameters()
i, j = iter_params

# Calculate the objective function (maximise source variance)
loss_i = sp.Sum(w_sp[j, 0] * X_sp[i, j], (j, 0, n_features - 1))
loss = -1 / n_samples * sp.Sum(loss_i**2, (i, 0, n_samples - 1))

# Set the properties within the instance
user_cost.set_cost(loss)

# Use SymPy to calculate the first and second order derivatives
user_cost.implement_methods()

# Check the implementation
X_ = np.random.randn(n_samples, n_features)
w_ = np.random.randn(n_features, 1)
y_ = X_ @ w_

res_grad = user_cost.check_gradient(X_, w_, y_,step_size = 1e-4)
res_hess = user_cost.check_hessian(X_, w_, y_,step_size = 1e-4)
```
