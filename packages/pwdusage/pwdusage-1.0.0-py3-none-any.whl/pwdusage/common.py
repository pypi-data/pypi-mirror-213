 Enum of all usage strings/pandas columns/values available for export to grafana.
 Utility class method for testing if a string is a valid enum name or string, 
 which returns the enum value.

# These are friendly versions of static pandas column names.
# Some new column names may also be derived from these (e.g. cost columns in
# usage agents).
# I've tried to go with the following naming convention "<source> <destination>" and
# "<demand> <demand modifier>".
# In general, if you plan to read a column name from an input file or add a calculated
# column to the pandas dataframe, you probably want to add the string to this enum and
# validate using cls.from_str().
#
# The exceptions to this rule are per tariff column names for energy and costs. These
# are be created dynamically from the calculated column name by the usage engine.
