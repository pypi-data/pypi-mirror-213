class UsageAgent(ABC):
    """_summary_
    UsageAgent is the base class of all usage engine calculation classes.
    Note that:
    - The usage engine and usage agents are tightly linked.
    - The usage engine will create a usage agent instance for each unique usage plan,
      and will also use that agent across all disjoint calendar periods that the usage
      plan applies for.
    - If can_persist returns true, the usage engine will keeps agents alive for long
      periods -  either until the pypowerwall server is restarted or the user requests
      a reload of usage engine configuration. The usage agent is responsible for
      ensuring internal data consistency. If in doubt, set up agents to return
      False and recalculate internal data each time the instance is created. (However:
      if your usage agent needs to perform intensive calculations whose results could
      be stored, True is probably what you want in the long term).
      - The implementer is responsible for managing race conditions in agents
      if persistence is allowed.

    Persistence is useful in two places (at least). First, if your agent is stateless
    (e.g. the simple agent), then there is no requirement to tear down and rebuild
    agents.

    Second, if you have  something like a usage plan that is based
    on tiered consumption - instead of calculating the tier breaks on each call, you
    could calculate them on demand and store for future use (with the caveat that you
    will need to keep an eye on current/future generation as well).

    A specific example where this second type might be used: Metaton's plan here:
    https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/discussions/68#discussioncomment-4616865.
    Each time the user agent encounters a new year, it could do the 600kWh transition
    and store it for future use (current generation year would require repeated
    calculations until transition). A similar approach could be applied to monthly
    tiered supply. Daily or shorter would probably be better recalculated each time.

    This is very untested! Right now, I only need a
    simple rate engine, so it's up to anyone who needs it to implement the appropriate
    agent. However, I've put in the hooks that I think might be needed for the future -
    these carry small overhead for agents that don't need them. So if they aren't ever
    used, delete in future? It may also make sense to push these stateful calcs back
    into influx?

    Repeating the warning above: agents are responsible for ensuring thread safety of
    instance data if can_persist is true.
