# The commit type should be one of: chore, feat, fix, perf, ref, rev.
# The scope is optional, it should be set when the changes are related
# to a plugin e.g. "fix(sphinx): broken home page url".
#
# Remember that this commit message will be read on two occasions:
#
# * during the code review, tonight, "what am I reviewing again?"
# * during a git blame, in 5 years, "why is this line needed again?"
#
# During a code review, we expect to understand the overall system and
# all the implications of your changes. The commit message should
# contain an abstract of the system being modified and recall the
# purpose of the changes.
#
# During a git-blame, we expect to remember the purpose of a specific
# line of code. Reading the commit diff and the commit message should
# give all the necessary information. If you don't feel like all your
# changes are correctly explained, maybe you should add a comment in
# the source code or isolate some changes in a new commit.
