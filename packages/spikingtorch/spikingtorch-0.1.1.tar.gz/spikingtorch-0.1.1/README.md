# spikingtorch

Training spiking neural networks using Pytorch


## About

`spikingtorch` is a lightweight module for training deep
spiking neural networks using Pytorch. `spikingtorch` includes
encoders that transform standard ML datasets into spike trains,
and decoders that transform the output spikes into values that
can be used with loss functions in Pytorch.


## Status

Spikingtorch is still in development.


## Quick install

Through pypi:

```
pip install spikingtorch
```
