## What's Golem and yapapi?

**[Golem](https://golem.network)** is a global, open-source, decentralized supercomputer that anyone can access.
It connects individual machines to form a vast network which combines their resources and allows requestors to utilize its unique potential - which may be its combined computing power, storage, the geographical distribution or its censorship resistance.

**Yapapi** is the Python high-level API that allows developers to connect to their Golem nodes and manage their distributed, computational loads through Golem Network.

## Golem application development

For a detailed introduction to using Golem and yapapi to run your tasks on Golem and a guide to Golem Network application development in general, [please consult our handbook](https://handbook.golem.network/requestor-tutorials/flash-tutorial-of-requestor-development).


### Installation

`yapapi` is available as a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/yapapi/).

You can install it through `pip`:
```
pip install yapapi
```

Or if your project uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) you can add it to your dependencies like this:
```
poetry add yapapi
```

### API Reference

For a comprehensive API reference, please refer to [our official readthedocs page](https://yapapi.readthedocs.io/).

## Local setup for yapapi developers

### Poetry
`yapapi` uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage its dependencies and provide a runner for common tasks.

If you don't have `poetry` available on your system then follow its [installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) before proceeding.
Verify your installation by running:
```
poetry --version
```

### Project dependencies
To install the project's dependencies run:
```
poetry install
```
By default, `poetry` looks for the required Python version on your `PATH` and creates a virtual environment for the project if there's none active (or already configured by Poetry).

All of the project's dependencies will be installed to that virtual environment.

### Running unit tests

`yapapi` uses [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) for running tasks.
Declarations of project tasks can be found in `pyproject.toml`.

```
poetry run poe test
```

### Running `goth` integration tests

#### Prerequisites

If you'd like to run the `yapapi` integration test suite locally then you'll need to install an additional set of dependencies separately.

First, install [the dependencies required to run goth](https://github.com/golemfactory/goth#requirements).

Next, [configure goth's GitHub API token](https://github.com/golemfactory/goth#getting-a-github-api-token).

Make sure you have OpenSSH installed and added to path

```
ssh -V
```

Now, you can install goth and its additional python requirements:

```
poetry install -E integration-tests
```

Finally, generate goth's default assets:

```
poetry run poe goth-assets
```

#### Running the tests

Once you have the environment set up, to run all the integration tests, use:

```
poetry run poe goth-tests
```

### Contributing

It is recommended to run unit tests and static code analysis before committing changes.

```
poetry run poe check
```

You can clean up the artifacts created during the test runs with:

```
poetry run poe clean
```

## Environment variables

It's possible to set various elements of `yagna` configuration through environment variables.
`yapapi` currently supports the following environment variables:
- `YAGNA_ACTIVITY_URL`, URL to `yagna` activity API, e.g. `http://localhost:7500/activity-api/v1`
- `YAGNA_API_URL`, base URL to `yagna` REST API, e.g. `http://localhost:7500`
- `YAGNA_APPKEY`, `yagna` app key to be used, e.g. `a70facb9501d4528a77f25574ab0f12b`
- `YAGNA_MARKET_URL`, URL to `yagna` market API, e.g. `http://localhost:7500/market-api/v1`
- `YAGNA_PAYMENT_NETWORK`, Ethereum network name for `yagna` to use, e.g. `rinkeby`
- `YAGNA_PAYMENT_DRIVER`, payment driver name for `yagna` to use, e.g. `erc20`
- `YAGNA_PAYMENT_URL`, URL to `yagna` payment API, e.g. `http://localhost:7500/payment-api/v1`
- `YAGNA_SUBNET`, name of the `yagna` sub network to be used, e.g. `public`
- `YAPAPI_USE_GFTP_CLOSE`, if set to a _truthy_ value (e.g. "1", "Y", "True", "on") then `yapapi`
  will ask `gftp` to close files when there's no need to publish them any longer. This may greatly
  reduce the number of files kept open while `yapapi` is running but requires `yagna`
  0.7.3 or newer, with older versions it will cause errors.
