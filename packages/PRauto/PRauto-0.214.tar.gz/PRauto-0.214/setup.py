        PRauto is a package for collecting and preprocessing protein and ligand data. 
        
        ## With prauto.py, you can perform the following tasks for a target protein:

           1. Collect FASTA file using Uniprot API
           2. Collect PDB file using RCSB PDB API
           3. Collect sdf file using ChEMBL API
        
        ## With get_preprocess.py, you can perform the following tasks:

           1. Extract the target chain from collected PDB files
           2. Align PDB files based on a chosen criterion
           3. Remove unnecessary molecules such as solvents and reagents from PDB files""",
