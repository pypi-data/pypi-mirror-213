        parameter.
        The Recommender System will first be fit for each user in the train set passed in the constructor.
        If the algorithm can't be fit for some users, a warning message is printed

        If the `n_recs` is specified, then the rank will contain the top-n items for the users.
        Otherwise, the rank will contain all unrated items of the particular users

        Via the `methodology` parameter you can perform different candidate item selection. By default, the
        `TestRatingsMethodology()` is used: so, for each user, items in its test set only will be ranked

        If the algorithm was not fit for some users, they will be skipped and a warning is printed

        With the `save_fit` parameter you can decide if you want that you recommender system remains *fit* even after
        the complete execution of this method, in case you want to compute ranking with other methodologies, or
        with a different `n_recs` parameter. Be mindful since it can be memory-expensive, thus by default this behaviour
        is disabled

        Args:

            n_recs: Number of the top items that will be present in the ranking of each user.
                If `None` all candidate items will be returned for the user
            user_id_list: List of users for which you want to compute the ranking. If None, the ranking will be computed
                for all users of the `test_set`
            methodology: `Methodology` object which governs the candidate item selection. Default is
                `TestRatingsMethodology`
            save_fit: Boolean value which let you choose if the Recommender System should remain fit even after the
                complete execution of this method. Default is False
            num_cpus: number of processors that must be reserved for the method. Default is 0, meaning that
                the number of cpus will be automatically detected.

        Raises:
            NotFittedAlg: Exception raised when this method is called without first calling the `fit` method

        Returns:
            Rank object containing recommendation lists for all users of the test set or for all users in `user_id_list`

    Class for recommender systems which use a graph in order to make predictions

        In case you perform a splitting of the dataset which returns a single train and test set (e.g. HoldOut

        gbrs = rs.GraphBasedRS(alg, graph)

        rank = gbrs.rank(test, n_recs=10)
        ```

        In case you perform a splitting of the dataset which returns a multiple train and test sets (KFold technique):

        ```python title="Multiple split train"
