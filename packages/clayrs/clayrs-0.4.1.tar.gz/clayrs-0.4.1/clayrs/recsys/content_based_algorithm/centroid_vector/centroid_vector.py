    """
    Class that implements a centroid-like recommender. It first gets the centroid of the items that the user liked.
    Then computes the similarity between the centroid and the item of which the ranking score must be predicted.
    It's a ranking algorithm, so it can't do score prediction

    *   It computes the centroid vector of the features of items *liked by the user*
    *   It computes the similarity between the centroid vector and the items of which the ranking score must be
    predicted

    The items liked by a user are those having a rating higher or equal than a specific **threshold**.
    If the threshold is not specified, the average score of all items liked by the user is used.

    Examples:
        * Interested in only a field representation, CosineSimilarity as similarity,
        $threshold = 3$ (Every item with rating $>= 3$ will be considered as positive)

        >>> from clayrs import recsys as rs
        >>> alg = rs.CentroidVector({"Plot": 0}, rs.CosineSimilarity(), 3)

        * Interested in multiple field representations of the items, CosineSimilarity as similarity,
        $threshold = None$ (Every item with rating $>=$ mean rating of the user will be considered as positive)

        >>> alg = rs.CentroidVector(
        >>>                      item_field={"Plot": [0, "tfidf"],
        >>>                                  "Genre": [0, 1],
