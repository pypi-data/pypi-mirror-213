class LinearPredictor(ContentBasedAlgorithm):
    """
    Class that implements recommendation through a specified linear predictor.
    It's a score prediction algorithm, so it can predict what rating a user would give to an unseen item.
    As such, it's also a ranking algorithm (it simply ranks in descending order unseen items by the predicted rating)

    Examples:

        * Interested in only a field representation, LinearRegression regressor from sklearn

        >>> from clayrs import recsys as rs
        >>> alg = rs.LinearPredictor({"Plot": 0}, rs.SkLinearRegression())

        * Interested in only a field representation, Ridge regressor from sklearn with custom parameters

        >>> alg = rs.LinearPredictor({"Plot": 0}, rs.SkRidge(alpha=0.8))

        * Interested in multiple field representations of the items, Ridge regressor from sklearn with custom
        parameters, $only_greater_eq = 2$ (Every item with rating $>= 2$ will be discarded and not considered in the
        ranking/score prediction task)

        >>> alg = rs.LinearPredictor(
        >>>                         item_field={"Plot": [0, "tfidf"],
        >>>                                     "Genre": [0, 1],
        >>>                                     "Director": "doc2vec"},
        >>>                         regressor=rs.SkRidge(alpha=0.8),
        >>>                         only_greater_eq=2)

            After instantiating the LinearPredictor algorithm, pass it in the initialization of
            a CBRS and the use its method to predict ratings or calculate ranking for a single user or multiple users:

            Examples:

                >>> cbrs = rs.ContentBasedRS(algorithm=alg, ...)
                >>> cbrs.fit_predict(...)
                >>> cbrs.fit_rank(...)
                >>> # ...

            use a list if you want to use multiple representations for a particular field.

        only_greater_eq: Threshold for the ratings. Only items with rating greater or equal than the

            matrix form instead of a single vector (e.g. when WordEmbedding representations must be used you have one
