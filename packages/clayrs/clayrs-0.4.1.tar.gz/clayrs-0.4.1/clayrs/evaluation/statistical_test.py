        Method which performs the chosen paired statistical test.

        Since it's a paired test, the final result is a pandas DataFrame which contains learning
        schemas compared in pair.
        For example if you call the `perform()` method by passing a list containing three different DataFrames, one for
        each learning schema to compare:

        ```python
        # Ttest as example since it's a Paired Test
        Ttest().perform([user_df1, user_df2, user_df3])
        ```

        You will obtain a DataFrame comparing all different combinations:

        * (system1, system2)
        * (system1, system3)
        * (system2, system3)

        The first value of each cell is the ***statistic***, the second is the ***p-value***

            df_list: List containing DataFrames with several metrics to compare, preferably metrics computed for each
                user. One DataFrame corresponds to one learning schema

        Returns:
            A Pandas DataFrame where each combination of learning schemas are compared in pair. The first value of each
                cell is the ***statistic***, the second is the ***p-value***
