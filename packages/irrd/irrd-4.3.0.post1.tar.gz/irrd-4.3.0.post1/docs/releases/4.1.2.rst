Release notes for IRRd 4.1.2
============================

IRRd 4.1.2 was released on February 10th, 2021, and resolves an
issue in the RPKI importer, where the status of certain objects
could be incorrect, if RPKI aware mode was enabled,
and one or more sources where excluded from RPKI validation.

Specifically, this applied to objects when:

* RPKI aware mode was enabled.
* Multiple route(6) objects existed with the same primary key
  (i.e. the same prefix and origin) in different sources.
* RPKI exclusion was enabled for one or more, but not all, of
  the sources with the identical primary key route(6) objects.
* According to RPKI data, the combination of prefix and origin
  was covered by a ROA.

In this situation, the object from the RPKI excluded source(s)
should be marked as not found, the other objects as invalid or
valid. However, the RPKI importer would incorrectly update all
objects with the same primary key, from all sources.

Therefore, on one run, all objects would be updated to not found,
then the next run, all objects to invalid or valid, flipping every
time the RPKI importer was run. If the objects were invalid according
to RPKI data, this also flipped them between being visible and
invisible.
