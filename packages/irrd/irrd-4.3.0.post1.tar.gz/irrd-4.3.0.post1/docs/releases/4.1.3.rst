Release notes for IRRd 4.1.3
============================

IRRd 4.1.3 was released on June 15th, 2021, and resolves a serious issue
where responses to ``!g``, ``!6`` and ``!a`` queries would be missing or
incomplete. This was mostly visible in certain situations with a high load
and/or a high ``server.whois.max_connections`` setting, but could occur in
any 4.1.x deployment.

This issue affected all previous 4.1.x versions. Upgrading is strongly
recommended for all deployments. The incorrect query responses occur
erratically but frequent, and it is not always visible to end users that
responses are incorrect. 4.0.x versions are not affected.

This issue would occur after changes to route(6) objects from any method,
including NRTM, authoritative change, and RPKI status change. All IRRd whois
workers keep a local store of all prefixes originated by each ASN, and this
store needs to be updated on every change to the (visible) route(6) objects.
This update was not atomic - causing queries to be answered from an empty or
incomplete store until the store was rebuilt. The rebuild time, and therefore
the time frame with incorrect responses, depends on the system load and number
of whois workers.

In 4.1.3, queries are answered from the existing store until the new one is
fully rebuilt.
