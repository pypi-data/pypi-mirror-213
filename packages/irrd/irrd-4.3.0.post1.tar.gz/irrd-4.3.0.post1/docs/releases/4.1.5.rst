Release notes for IRRd 4.1.5
============================

IRRd 4.1.5 was released on August 24th, 2021, with a number of fixes and
improvements:

* AS4294967295, the highest valid 32 bit AS number, is now accepted by IRRd.
  Previously, the ASN validator would reject it. This affected ROA imports
  in particular, as the entire ROA file is rejected when a single entry is
  invalid.
* A new guide for
  :doc:`availability and data migration </admins/availability-and-migration>`
  was added. This includes several new settings to support read-only IRRd
  instances, exports and NRTM queries that include password hashes, and a new
  command to load PGP keys from the SQL database into the GnuPG keyring.
* The scope filter did not validate `aut-num` objects, always considering them
  to be in scope. After updating to 4.1.5, the next scope filter run will
  update the status of all `aut-num` objects correctly, if enabled.
* Incorrect ADD entries could appear in the database journal. If an object was
  RPKI invalid and out of scope, and became in scope but remained RPKI invalid
  due to a configuration change, an ADD was added to the journal
  (and NRTM output) incorrectly. The object should remain invisible to mirrors,
  as it was still RPKI invalid. The same could occur when an out of scope and
  RPKI invalid object would become RPKI valid or not found, while remaining
  out of scope.
