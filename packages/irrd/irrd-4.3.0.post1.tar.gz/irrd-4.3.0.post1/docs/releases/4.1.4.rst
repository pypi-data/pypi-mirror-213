============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.1.4
============================

IRRd 4.1.4 was released on June 18th, 2021, and extends the permitted
format for the :doc:`RPKI ROA source </admins/rpki>` configured in
``rpki.roa_source``.

IRRd now allows the ASN in this JSON file to be encoded as an integer,
in addition to the existing support for encoding it as a string prefixed
with ``AS``.
This newly supported integer encoding of AS numbers is used in the
latest version of the JSON export of rpki-client_.
