============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.1.1
============================

An issue was fixed in the RPKI importer, where it would cause other
database changes to be blocked during part of the RPKI import.
No data was lost, but NRTM imports and authoritative changes would
be delayed for up to 5-10 minutes on every RPKI import.
