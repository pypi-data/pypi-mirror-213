============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.1.7
============================

IRRd 4.1.7 was released on September 7th, 2021, and fixes an issue where
the NRTM parser `would accept partial content`_. In case of poor network
connectivity, the TCP connection could break while receiving NRTM data.
IRRd would then process the received part, potentially causing updates to be
missed.

In 4.1.7, IRRd will reject and log any NRTM response with a valid ``START`` line
that does not end in ``%END <source name>``, as they are assumed to be
incomplete. Upon the next NRTM import, IRRd will automatically retry retrieving
the same updates - like with any other NRTM failure.
