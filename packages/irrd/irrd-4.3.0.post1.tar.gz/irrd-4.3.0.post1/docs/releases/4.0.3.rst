Release notes for IRRd 4.0.3
============================

IRRd 4.0.3 was released on June 29th, 2019, and contains
one change relating to referential integrity validation
between RPSL objects.

In earlier versions of IRRd, the `members` attribute of
an `as-set`, along with several others,
`were strongly validated`_. This meant it was not possible
to add or update an `as-set`, if some of the members were
not valid objects in the same source. The same applied
to fields like `member-of` in a `route-set`.

In IRRd 4.0.3, all references from `members`, `mp-member`,
`mbrs-by-ref` and `member-of` are weak references. Their
syntax is validated, e.g. for `as-set` members, values must
be a valid `as-set` name or a valid AS number. However, there
is no validation on whether the objects actually exist.
It is also possible to delete e.g. a `route-set`, even when
the object is still listed in the `member-of` in a `route`
object, or to reference a maintainer that does not exist
in a `mbrs-by-ref`.
