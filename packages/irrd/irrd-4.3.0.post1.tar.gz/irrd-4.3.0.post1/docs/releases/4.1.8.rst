Release notes for IRRd 4.1.8
============================

IRRd 4.1.8 was released on October 29th, 2021, and fixes two issues that
occurred in all previous 4.1 releases:

* IRRd's whois worker processes `could use excessive memory`_.
* The ``scopefilter_enabled`` value in the ``!J`` `was incorrect`_ in some cases.

The memory issue occurred mainly when answering queries with large responses.
Those cause high memory consumption in the workers, which is expected, but after
answering the query, the workers did not always release the memory.
