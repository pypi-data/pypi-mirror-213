Release notes for IRRd 4.2.5
============================

IRRd 4.2.5 was released on June 24th, 2022, and fixes several issues:

* `Deletions could fail`_ for cases where the same RPSL primary key
  was used in the same source for different objects with different
  object classes. This could prevent NRTM updates from progressing.
  Any mirroring processes that were stuck due to this bug will
  recover after upgrading.
* The irrd_load_pgp_keys_ command was missing from the distribution.
* An obscure situation where a non-ASCII character
  `could be permitted in RPSL primary keys`_ was corrected.
* Added a warning that when using PostgreSQL replication, the
  `local preload store may not be updated`_ causing
  potential stale responses to queries.
