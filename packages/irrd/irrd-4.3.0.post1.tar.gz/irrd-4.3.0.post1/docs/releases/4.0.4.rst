Release notes for IRRd 4.0.4
============================

IRRd 4.0.4 was released on July 15th, 2019, and contains
one change relating to the behaviour of `changed:`
attributes in RPSL objects.

In earlier versions of IRRd, format of the `changed`
attribute was entirely free. In IRRd 4.0.4, the format
is expected to be ``<email> [YYYYMMDD]`` with an optional
comment, as allowed with other RPSL attributes. The date
is optional. Regardless of the date, if any, set in the
attribute, it will be `overwritten`_ by today's date,
unless the override password was used. Pre-existing
`changed` attributes are not affected.
