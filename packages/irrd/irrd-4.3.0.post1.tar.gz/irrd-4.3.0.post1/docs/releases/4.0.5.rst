============================
Release notes for IRRd 4.0.5
============================

IRRd 4.0.5 was released on September 2nd, 2019, and fixes
two bugs.

In earlier versions of IRRd, queries that looked up
the routes originating from a certain AS,
`did not correctly filter for the selected sources`_.
Also, the ``!s-lc`` query did not always correctly display
which sources were currently selected.
