# Colourspace
_Colourspace_ is a Python library and viewer tool used to render videos and
images in the proper colourspace using the _colorspace_ _FFmpeg_ filter.

It uses the _av_ package to access _FFmpeg_ functionality, and _pymediainfo_
to obtain file and stream metadata, that is not yet available through _av_
(even though it _is_ available in _FFmpeg_).

Note: _PyAV_ uses a (rather) outdated version of FFmpeg: 5.1.2, which may lack bug fixes
and support for newer functionality. Check the [FFmpeg build script][1] for PyAV.
