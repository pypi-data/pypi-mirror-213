# Atlas App Framework

This is a simple framework for creating Class based applications that can be run as a command line application or importated and run as a module. It's goal is to remove a lot of boiler plate that is typically done when writting CLI and GUI apps.

## Documentation

Our docs can be found [here](https://renderbox.github.io/atlas-framework) on GitHub Pages.

This project is tested against Python 3.7-3.11
