# GPT-Fn

GPT-Fn is a lightweight utility library designed to seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into your software applications. Our focus is on providing essential utilities that make it easy to incorporate artificial intelligence into your codebase without unnecessary complexities.

## Features

- **Function-like API**: With GPT-Fn, you can utilize AI capabilities in your code just like any other function. No need to learn complex AI frameworks or APIs; simply call our functions and harness the power of AI effortlessly.

- **AI Integration**: GPT-Fn seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art AI models, allowing you to perform tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, sentiment analysis, and much more.

- **Flexible Configuration**: We provide a range of configurable options to fine-tune the behavior of AI functions according to your specific requirements. Customize the models, parameters, and output formats to suit your application's needs.

- **Well Tested**: GPT-Fn comes with a comprehensive suite of test cases, ensuring the reliability and stability of the library. We strive to provide a robust solution that you can trust in your production environments.

- **Open-Source**: GPT-Fn is an open-source project, enabling collaboration and contribution from the developer community. Feel free to explore the source code, suggest improvements, and contribute to making GPT-Fn even more powerful.

## Installation

You can install GPT-Fn using pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install gpt-fn
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt-fn.git
cd gpt-fn
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Getting Started

To start using GPT-Fn in your project, import the library and call the desired AI function:

```python
from gpt_fn import text_generation

input_text = "Once upon a time"
generated_text = text_generation.generate_text(input_text, max_length=100)

print(generated_text)
```

In the example above, we use the `text_generation.generate_text` function to generate additional text based on an initial input. You can explore other available AI functions in the GPT-Fn documentation for a wide range of AI tasks.
