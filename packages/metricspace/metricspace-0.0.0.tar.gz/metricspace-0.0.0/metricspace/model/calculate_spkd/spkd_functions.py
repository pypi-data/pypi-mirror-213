"""metricspace.distance.calculate_spkd.calculate_spkd.py

Contains internal spike distance calculation functions. These functions are
called by the public functions in metricspace.distance.spkd.py and metricspace.distance.spkd_slide.py.

They are private to clean up the public namespace, avoid circular imports, and prevent confusion about which
spike distance function is being called.
