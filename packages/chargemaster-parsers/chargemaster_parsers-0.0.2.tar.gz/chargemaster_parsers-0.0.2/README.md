# chargemaster_parsers
Healthcare Chargemaster Parsers

# Goals
The primary objective for now is to process (where available) the outpatient data from chargemasters for healthcare institutions in California.
The output should be a collection of objects with a common interface to simplify bulk processing.

# Requirements
Python 3.9+

# Running Unit tests
Unit tests are implemented in pytest and are located in the src/tests directory.
To run, you must first create a virtual environment and install the package (preferably in editable mode for local testing).
As an example using the venv module:

  ```bash
  cd src
  python -m venv venv
  venv/scripts/Activate
  pip install -e .
  ```

Next install pytest

  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

Then to run the tests:

  ```bash
  python -m pytest
  ```

# Downloading and parsing
To utilize the library for a particular institution:

  ```python
  from chargemaster_parsers.parsers import ChargeMasterParser

  # Choose your institution
  institution = "scripps"

  # Create a parser for it - either use the factory method and give it an
  # institution name, or you can import the specific parser subclass you want
  #
  # from chargemaster_parsers.parsers import ScrippsChargeMasterParser
  # parser = ScrippsChargeMasterParser()

  parser = ChargeMasterParser.build(institution)

  # Download the artifacts however you see fit - note this way requires a lot of
  # RAM - you will likely need to store them off to disk. For now make a pretend
  # file in memory with io. Note that some institutions may require headers that
  # look like a browser or they will fail.
  import urllib.request
  import io

  artifacts = {}
  for artifact_url in parser.artifact_urls:
      with urllib.request.urlopen(artifact_url) as response:
          artifacts[artifact_url] = io.BytesIO(response.read())

  # Parse the downloaded artifacts into chargemaster entries
  for chargemaster_entry in parser.parse_artifacts(artifacts):
      print(chargemaster_entry)
  ```

# Prior works to reference:
This is certainly not the first, nor will it be the last attempt at this.
Many have had similar ideas, though most are ultimately doomed to become out of date.
