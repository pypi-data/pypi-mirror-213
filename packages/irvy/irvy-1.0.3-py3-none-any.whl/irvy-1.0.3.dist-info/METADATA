# Installation and Usage Guide for Irvy

This guide will walk you through installing Python and using Irvy on different operating systems. We will cover installation on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## Prerequisites
Before we start, ensure you have the following:

- A working computer with one of the following operating systems: Windows, MacOS, Linux.
- Access to the command line terminal.

## Installing Python

Irvy requires Python 3.7 or later. Follow the steps below to install Python on your operating system.

### Windows

1. Download the latest Python release from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. Run the installer, ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked, then follow the installation prompts.

### MacOS

1. MacOS comes preinstalled with Python, but it's typically an older version. You can use Homebrew to install the latest version.
2. If you don't have Homebrew, install it with the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. Install Python with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```

### Linux

Different Linux distributions have different methods to install Python. Here's how you can install Python on Ubuntu:

1. Update your system:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. Install Python:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3
   ```

## Verify Python Installation

Verify your Python installation by checking the version in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see output like `Python 3.11.3` or later.

## Install Irvy

You can install Irvy directly from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install irvy
```

## Using Irvy

After successfully installing Irvy, you can run it by simply typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
irvy
```

This will start an interactive command-line interface where you can select the language and tool you want to use for your project. Follow the prompts to generate your test automation project.
