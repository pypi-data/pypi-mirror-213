    later be used to validate that the key is of a correct format, to avoid
    checking the database for a key that wouldn't possibly be valid to begin with.

    whether the key already exists, meaning you avoid choosing short key
    formats, such as 1 section with 5 characters, of course allowed characters
    also play a role here.

    it's lifetime, thus they are hashed by key.
