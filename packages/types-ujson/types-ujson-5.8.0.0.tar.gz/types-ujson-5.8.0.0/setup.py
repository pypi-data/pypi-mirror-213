## Typing stubs for ujson

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `ujson` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`ujson`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/ujson. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `6a94c9d677db9e9f85d764cc46294fd5c5e2a4b8`.
